I found this program to be difficult at first, but once I began it was not too difficult.
The hardest part was using the for loops to create strings from the numbers,
but I tried the method I used and it worked.
Besides this, the program was fairly simple.
I hope to have more programs like this in the future, because I feel they are more enjoyable.
