I did not have a hard time with this program. I did not feel that the Javadocs would be too helpful in this program,
since it is so small in terms of code, I can definitely see how it can help in future, larger programs that will be written.
I find the idea of the Javadocs to be very smart, and I think it alone makes Java a much more user friendly program than most.
