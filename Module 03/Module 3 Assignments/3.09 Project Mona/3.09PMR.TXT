I found this program to be fairly challenging, and it forced be to rethink different problems multiple times.
I also learned a lot about the best ways to use differnt methods, mainly the scanner methods, through this program.
I did get stuck for a while on the email, but this was because I didn't realize the first and last names of the users were two seperate strings.
I have there are more programs like this in the future, because I feel these types of programs help me best to prepare for the AP Exam.
