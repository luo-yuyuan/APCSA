I found this program to be more challenging than previous programs, but still not overly difficult.
The one piece that I did find challenging was the total items for souvenir 2. I changed it's data type 
and added more data conversions because I felt this solution made more sense than using the value as an int,
to ensure that the proper value is found and then truncated the decimal, as opposed to truncating then calculatting.

I also used: https://www.bankofamerica.com/foreign-exchange/currency-converter.go#131MXN for my conversions.
