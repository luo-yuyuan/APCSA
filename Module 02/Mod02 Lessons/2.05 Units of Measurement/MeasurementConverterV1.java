/**
 * MeasuermentConverter_v1 converts to and from Metric and English
 * units of measure.
 *
 *      Sample Calculation:
 *        1 mile = 5280 ft,
 *        therefore    6230 ft / 5280 = 1.17992 miles
 *          and    1.179 miles * 5280 = 6225.12 ft

 * Description:
 *  This program is designed to convert between set units of measurement using variables.
 *  Conversion factors are set into variables and are used to convert between to measurements, both ways.
 *  The purpose of this program is to practice using variables
