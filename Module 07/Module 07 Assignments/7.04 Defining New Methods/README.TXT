I did not have much trouble with this program, and I feel it was good to 
help me with creating my own methods.
My gravities and weights are slightly off from the example, but I believe 
this is due to different values being used and rounding.
The only thing I am confused about is when to use "throws IOException".
I thought I only had to use it in my method with the scanner, but BlueJ
made me use it in my main method as well to compile.
