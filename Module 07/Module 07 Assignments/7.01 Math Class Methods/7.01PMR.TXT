The biggest problem I had in this program was with the fact that the values slowly drifted away from 
their actual values (7.0 vs 7.00000000000000001), causing inaccuracy in the program, and the lack of zero being using.
For this reason I decided to use ints and convert it into a double every time, leading to more valid 
values.
Besides this problem, I did not have other difficulties.
