I found this program to be easy yet interesting.
I would like to know if there is a way to end the program is it reaches the else statement, since it will not run properly.
I also enjoyed this topic, since I am personally into nutrition and fitness, and TDEE is a topic which comes up a fair bit. I may come back to it sometime - as a user!
